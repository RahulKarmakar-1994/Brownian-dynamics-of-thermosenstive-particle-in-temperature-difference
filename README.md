# Brownian-dynamics-of-thermosenstive-particle-in-temperature-difference
Here I have simulated some thermoresponsive particles in temperature difference using Brownian dynamics simulation. Particles interaction and diffusivity are dependent on local temperature region in each step.

Here there is force calculation. Force calculation is done using openmp for parallel computation for faster executation.
